# party-invites
A web application in Golang using HTML and CSS that allows you to invite friends to a party. Each friend will be able to accept or decline the invitation, as well as view the list of guests who will attend the party.

This example is an interpretation of one of the tasks from the book ["Pro Go" by Adam Freeman.](https://www.amazon.com/Pro-Go-Complete-Programming-Efficient/dp/1484273540)
